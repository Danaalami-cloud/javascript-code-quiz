# javascript-code-quiz

For this assignmnet, I was able to creat a quiz based on JavaScript questions with main focus on using Javascript to activate the game, and HTML as a whiteboard for a starter. 
I faced some issues with it, and had difficulties debugging a bug that I have, but I will try to redo it in the future for next time.

Kindly find a screenshot of the game
